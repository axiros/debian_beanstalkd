beanstalkd (1.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of 1.9-2, beanstalkd ships a systemd socket unit file to facilitate
  socket activation via systemd. The socket activation is disabled by default,
  if you want to use it you need to stop the service and manually enable and
  start the systemd socket:

      $ systemctl stop beanstalkd.service
      $ systemctl enable beanstalkd.socket
      $ systemctl start beanstalkd.socket

  These steps need to be performed only once and will bind 127.0.0.1:11300
  and pass it down to beanstalkd. Note that if you enable socket activation,
  the port and address specified in /etc/default/beanstalkd will not be used.

  As with all systemd unit files, you can override beanstalkd.socket by
  copying it to /etc/systemd/system/ and modifying it.

  For more information about socket activation, see systemd.socket(5).
